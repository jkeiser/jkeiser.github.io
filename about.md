title: About

I have been a coder since I first picked up an Apple IIc clone in 1988, grabbed a book with code for an adventure game from the library, and adapted it over to paper during English and History classes. Since then I've worked on search engines and distributed storage, compilers and network protocols, browsers and websites. I've been a developer, a tester, a project manager, and I've run a company. You might summarize my career as "I build the internet."

Right now I work for [Chef](https://chef.io), on another new thing to me--setting up and configuring distributed systems. The work of getting machines, networking them together, installing and upgrading and orchestrating and oh my! It's a thing I've always been bad at, and it's critical so I'm happy for the opportunity to try to make the world better for, well, me. With any luck, other people have the same problems I did :)
